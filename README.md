# Fall 2020 Personal Portfolio

Hello, 

I am Tyra Krehbiel, a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia.

This is a side project of mine where I have been experimenting with the React Library and Typescript language--but now it has been repurposed to be my personal website!

This React Web Application is a quick project that I implemented to showcase who I am and my interests. It is an ongoing project that I will continue to update as I advance my skills and envision ways to innovate this site. 

Feel free to check it out, and check back in a couple weeks down the line, then again a couple weeks after that as I actively create a simple and interactive portfolio site.
